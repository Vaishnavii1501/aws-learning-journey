# 🌐 What is a Domain Name?

A domain name is the human-readable address of a website (e.g., `example.com`). In AWS, managing domains typically involves:

- Registering domain names
- Managing DNS records
- Integrating with services like Route 53

---

## 🛠️ AWS Services Involved

### 1. **Amazon Route 53**
> A scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

- Register domain names
- Configure DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.)
- Enable routing policies (Latency-based, Failover, Geolocation, etc.)
- Health checks and monitoring

## 🔗 Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **DNS** | Domain Name System – translates domain names to IP addresses |
| **A Record** | Maps a domain to an IPv4 address |
| **CNAME Record** | Alias from one domain name to another |
| **TTL** | Time to Live – how long DNS info is cached |
| **Hosted Zone** | A container for DNS records in Route 53 |
| **Registrar** | Entity used to register domain names (AWS can act as this) |
