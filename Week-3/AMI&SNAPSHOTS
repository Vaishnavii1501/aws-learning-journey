AMIs & Snapshots

---

## 📦 What is an AMI?

**Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a pre-configured template for launching EC2 instances.

### 🔧 AMI Includes:
- An operating system
- Application server and applications
- Optional configuration and permissions

### 📌 Why use AMIs?
- Launch identical EC2 instances quickly
- Backup and replicate environments
- Create custom templates for your deployments

---

## 🖼️ Creating an AMI

1. Launch and configure an EC2 instance
2. Go to EC2 → Instances → Select instance
3. Click **Actions → Image and Templates → Create Image**
4. Provide name & description
5. AWS creates:
   - The **AMI**
   - One or more **Snapshots** of attached volumes

---

## 💾 What is a Snapshot?

**Snapshot** is a backup of an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume at a point in time.

### ⚙️ Snapshot Use Cases:
- Back up important data
- Create new volumes from snapshots
- Restore volumes after failure
- Use in different availability zones

## 🔁 Relationship Between AMIs and Snapshots

| AMI | Snapshot |
|-----|----------|
| Used to launch EC2 | Used to backup EBS volumes |
| Can include multiple snapshots | A single volume backup |
| Contains OS, config, and data | Contains only volume data |

> 🔗 Every AMI has at least one snapshot (for the root EBS volume).

## 🔐 Notes on Encryption

- Snapshots can be **encrypted** at creation or copied into encrypted versions.
- Encrypted snapshots can only be restored into encrypted volumes.

## 🧩 Next Steps

- [ ] Try creating custom AMI with Apache installed
- [ ] Test launching new EC2 from that AMI
- [ ] Explore snapshot scheduling using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager
