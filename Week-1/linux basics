Linux Basics on EC2
Today, I explored Linux basics by launching an EC2 instance and working with the terminal inside it. Here’s what I did:

☁️ Launched EC2 Instance:
Chose a free-tier t2.micro instance with a Linux-based AMI

Added a security group rule:

Type: SSH

Port: 22

Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

Downloaded the .pem key file for SSH access

🔐 Connected via SSH:

chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<your-public-ip>
🧑‍💻 Practiced Linux Commands:
File navigation: ls, cd, pwd

File management: mkdir, touch, rm, mv, cp

User & permissions: whoami, sudo, chmod, chown

File editing: nano, cat, echo

Network & system info: ifconfig, top, df -h, uptime

✅ Gained hands-on experience with the Linux CLI using a real cloud server.
