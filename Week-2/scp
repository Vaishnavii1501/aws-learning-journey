🔐 Explored SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)

Today, I learned how to transfer files securely between my local machine and EC2 instance using SCP.

📦 What is SCP?
SCP is a command-line tool used to copy files and directories securely over SSH.

Useful for transferring code, configuration files, or any data between local and remote servers.

📤 Uploading a file from local to EC2:

scp -i your-key.pem filename.txt ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:/home/ubuntu/
📥 Downloading a file from EC2 to local:

scp -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:/home/ubuntu/filename.txt /path/to/local/
📁 Recursive folder transfer (important!):
To copy a whole folder, use the -r flag:


scp -i your-key.pem -r myfolder ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:/home/ubuntu/
🔒 Tips:
Always use correct path and permissions.

Use chmod 400 your-key.pem before using SCP.

The connection is secured using SSH encryption, ensuring safe transfer.

SCP is now my go-to tool for moving files during EC2 setups! 🚀
