# ðŸš€ LEMP + AWS S3 File Upload Project

This project demonstrates a PHP web application running on a LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack, allowing users to upload files that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. File metadata (name and URLs) is stored in a MySQL database, and CloudFront URLs are optionally generated for faster file delivery.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Upload files through a web form
- Store files in AWS S3
- Generate public S3 and CloudFront URLs
- Save metadata to MySQL
- Runs on a LEMP stack (Linux + Nginx + MySQL + PHP)
- Uses AWS SDK for PHP via Composer

Let me know if you also want:
- a working `index.html` form file,
- the modified `upload.php` with actual AWS code,
- or deployment on a remote EC2 server.
